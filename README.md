# This is a homework project for the Information System Master Degree for 6205 class at Northeastern University


Hello TA, My name is Yaokun Ren and I am really sorry for my delay at submitting the homework. From the past of few week, I have push myself totally into the interview for the 2022 summer internship, and I really really want to get an offer from it. So I use all of my time to prepare the interview and I have told our professor well about it. He told me not to worry about the class and got the offer first. And now I have finished all my intern interview and now I think is time for me to make up the homework. I am feel so guilty for bringing the inconvenience to you, I want to express my great appreciation to you!
